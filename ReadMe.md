# TODO top priority
- fix a message passing format,  asio read until is badly explotable
  - or make a timeout

# UnSolved solvable Problems
- find a way to stop DoS attack
  - expect the player to send contiunues (in a loop) send garbage or semi-garbage data
  - find a way to detect and ban such ip or better device id 
    - with some way of notifying the user of this
  -  even if undetected the excess packets must be dropped early as possible
     -  only open read from socket mode at and for a perticular time frame and for only some amopunt of data
        -  in asio i think the minimum queue is 1048
